# WritersApp

Writers register to the andorid application and automatically receive 
a picture(Random picture of an illustrated monster). Writers can 
write stories and poems. Poems can be searched, and after reading a 
poem, we can like it or write a comment. We can also remember a 
poem that we like so it could be easier to find it later.
